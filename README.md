# btm (Better Twitch Menu)

This chrome extension is designed to rework the "Followed Channels"-menu in the left side to a more useful version.

## Features

* Show/Hide of Top Bar using doubleclick anywhere on the page
* Left side menu is now an overlay, displaying when moving the mouse in the upper left corner and only consists of only the followed channels
* Followed Channels can be grouped by category
* Sort by alphabet or viewers
* additional display of live followed channels in the Top Bar

## Installation

Go to the Releases Page, download the CRX-file and drop it into your chromium-based browser. 

If the extension won't show up (propably happening in Vivaldi), download the zip-Version, unpack it, switch Developer-mode in the extension manager on and load the unpacked version
