# btm (Better Twitch Menu)

This chrome extension is designed to rework the "Followed Channels"-menu in the left side to a more useful version.

## Features

* Show/Hide of Top Bar using doubleclick anywhere on the page
* Left side menu is now an overlay, displaying when moving the mouse in the upper left corner and only consists of only the followed channels
* Followed Channels can be grouped by category
* Sort by alphabet or viewers
* additional display of live followed channels in the Top Bar

## Installation

### In Google Chrome

Chrome only accepts sideloading extensions if the extension is signed by the Chrome Web Store, which this isn't. Install the extension By Source.

### In Opera

Download the CRX file and drop it into the browser

### In Vivaldi

Vivaldi does not react when dropping the CRX file unless you turn on Developer mode in `chrome://extensions/`

### By Source (works in all chromium based browser)

1. Download the source of the extension ("Source Code (zip)" of the [Release](https://github.com/gruzzlebeard/btm/releases/latest))
2. Unpack it somewhere
3. Open `chrome://extensions/`
4. Enable "Developer mode" (upper right corner)
5. Click "Load unpacked" (upper left corner)
6. Navigate into the unpacked directory and click Select Folder
7. The extension now appears and Developer Mode can be turned off again

You will not be asked for permissions due to Developer mode, but you can view the required permissions (and more) by clicking on Details. There you also can find the extensions' settings.
